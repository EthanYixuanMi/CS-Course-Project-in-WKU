# Java Multi-Function Console Application

This is a Java console-based application that offers a collection of practical utilities, accessible through an interactive menu. It serves as a comprehensive final project or as a practice tool for learning core Java concepts.

## Features

Upon running the program, users are presented with the following menu options:

1. **Addition Quiz**
   Generates simple random addition problems to help users practice mental math.

2. **Lottery Game**
   Simulates a lottery number drawing and compares user input to randomly generated numbers.

3. **Income Tax Calculator**
   Calculates the amount of income tax based on the user's input.

4. **COVID Official Statistics**
   Displays static or simulated data related to COVID-19 statistics.

5. **Monte Carlo Simulation**
   Demonstrates basic Monte Carlo probability simulations using random sampling.

6. **Print Calendar**
   Outputs a formatted calendar for a given month and year.

7. **Print 50 Prime Numbers**
   Prints the first 50 prime numbers to the console.

8. **Exit**
   Terminates the program.

## Project Structure

* `FinalProject.java`: The main class containing the primary loop, menu logic, and method calls to each feature.
* Each feature may be implemented as a separate method within the main class for modularity.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. Compile and run the program via terminal:

```bash
javac FinalProject.java
java Project.FinalProject
```

> Note: The package name is `Project`, so make sure the file is located in a `Project/` directory.

## Requirements

* Java 8 or above
* Command-line terminal with standard input/output support

## Future Improvements

* Refactor features into separate classes and interfaces for better modularity
* Implement a graphical user interface (GUI)
* Add persistent storage (e.g., to save quiz scores or lottery history)

## Author

This project was developed as a final assignment to practice core and advanced Java programming skills.
