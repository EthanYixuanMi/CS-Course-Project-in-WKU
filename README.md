# Java-Projects

## About the Author

These projects were created by **Mi Yixuan**, a passionate student from Wenzhou-Kean University with a keen interest in Java programming, software development, and scientific research.

## Project Overview

This repository showcases a collection of Java projects that demonstrate Mi Yixuan's programming skills and academic journey. The projects fall into three main categories:

1. **Course Final Projects**: These projects represent the culmination of various computer science courses taken by Mi Yixuan at Wenzhou-Kean University. They demonstrate the practical application of theoretical concepts learned in class.

2. **Internship Projects**: Some projects in this repository were developed during Mi Yixuan's internships at various companies, providing real-world programming experience and showcasing professional-grade code.

3. **Science Research Project**: This project represents Mi Yixuan's foray into scientific research, combining computer science principles with interdisciplinary scientific inquiry.
