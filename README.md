## Repository Overview

This repository contains documentation and code for the following projects:

### 1. **SmartCourse: Course Selection System with AI Suggestion Module** (Highlighted)
**Course**: CPS3320 - Python Programming    

**Description**: SmartCourse is an intelligent course selection platform that simplifies scheduling by offering personalized recommendations based on students' academic history, major, and four-year plans. 

**Key Features:**
- **AI-Powered Guidance**: Combines course registration with an on-premise AI adviser, turning enrollment into a data-driven mentoring experience.
- **Lightweight & Modular**: Uses a Python codebase with plain-text storage, eliminating the need for heavy databases or cloud subscriptions, while allowing 
easy migration to SQL/REST. 
- **Dual UI for Flexibility**: CLI for quick admin tasks and Gradio for a modern web interface, ensuring accessibility with role-based permissions. 
- **Automated Notifications**:  Email alerts keep students and instructors updated without manual follow-ups.
- **Centralized Logging**: Simplifies auditing and tracking of system activity.
- **Cost & Privacy Benefits**: Local AI (via Ollama) avoids external API costs and enhances data security.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduces advising bottlenecks while providing personalized scheduling. 
- **Easy Maintenance**: Modular design ensures sustainable usability and straightforward updates.

**Technologies Used**: Python, Gradio UI Design, Ollama-served LLM, SMTP service, File I/O
